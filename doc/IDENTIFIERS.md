# Identifiers

An identifier is a name used to refer to a C entity. Identifiers can be of arbitrary length, but must begin with a non-digit character. An identifier can contain only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and Unicode characters.

Identifiers can refer to the following entites:
* Objects
* Functions
* `struct`, `union`, and `enum` tags
* `struct`, `union`, and `enum` members
* Type aliases
* Labels
* Macros and macro parameters

Some identifier names are reserved by the language and therefore cannot be used. These include language keywords and any identifiers which begin with one or more underscores, followed by an upper case character. The full list of reserved identifiers can be found online.
