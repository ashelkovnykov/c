# Statement

A C program is a sequence of commands executed in order. Statements are the commands which comprise the program. There are 5 types of statement:
1. Expression statement
2. Selection statement
3. Iteration statement
4. Jump statement
5. Compound statement

## Expression Statement

The most common type of statement. Variable assignments, function calls, operations, and null statements are all expression statements.

## Selection Statement

A selection statement evaluates an expression to determine which of several statements should be executed. `if` and `switch` statements are selection statements.

## Iteration Statement

An iteration statement executes another statement multiple times (the exact number of which may be determined by an expression). `do`, `for` and `while` statements are iteration statements.

## Jump Statement

A jump statement modifies the flow of the program. `break`, `continue`, `return` and `goto` statements are jump statements.

## Compound Statement

A compound statement groups multiple statements and declarations into a single unit which can be used anywhere where a single statement is expected. A compound statement is denoted by wrapping the component statements and declarations with braces (`{}`) to form what is called a "block" of code.
