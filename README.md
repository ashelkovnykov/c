# C

This project serves the following purposes:
1. Document and demonstrate C language features
3. Document and demonstrate the best C project layout practices

If you see a mistake, please do not hesitate to leave a comment. I did my best to find and organize as much information regarding professional C development as I could, but I am not a full-time C developer. This project was a stepping-stone to re-familiarizing myself with C++ after 6 years of working in Scala.
