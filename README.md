## Usage

Use this project to familiarize yourself language features, syntax, and best practices of the C language. Check the README files, browse the source code, and don't skip the comments.

## Installation

The purpose of this project is primarily to browse the source code and project layout. However, for the purposes of testing, the project does compile. In addition, every line of code is tested during compilation and executed during run.

This project has been configured (ideally) to run on any OS. However, it has only been tested on the following systems:
- Windows 7 Home Ultimate 64-bit
- Pop!_OS 20.04 Linux
- macOS 10.15 Catalina

To install the project, pull it locally and compile it by running the following commands:
- **Windows:**
- **Linux:**
- **Mac:**

Afterwards, run the created executable; the output is self-explanatory.

## Contributing

If you see a mistake, please do not hesitate to leave a comment, open an issue, or submit a pull request. I did my best to find and organize as much information regarding professional C development as I could, but I am not a full-time C developer. This project was a stepping-stone to re-familiarizing myself with C++ after 6 years of working in Scala.
