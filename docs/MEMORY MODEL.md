# Memory Model

The C memory model is built around **bytes**. A 'byte' is the smallest addressable unit of memory. It is a contiguous sequence of bits large enough to hold any member of the execution character set (therefore a byte must be at least 6 bits in length.) All modern C compilers use a byte length of 8 bits.
